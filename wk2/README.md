# Deque and Randomized Queue

Implementations of the above; specification <a href="https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php">here</a>.

Functional, and efficient time- and memory-wise, but not exactly beautiful.

* Odd stuff with iterators to be fixed - they should be called implicitly
* Contains tabs
* "N" should be "n" (non-final variable)
